## Egocentric Depth on everyday INdoor Activities (EDINA) Dataset
:star2: Dataset is coming soon! 

### Overview
EDINA is an egocentric dataset that comprises more than 500K synchronized RGBD frames and gravity directions. Each instance in the dataset is a triplet: RGB image, depths and surface normals, and 3D gravity direction.

### Capturing Process
The data were collected using Azure Kinect cameras that provide RGBD images with inertial signals (rotational velocity and linear acceleration). Eighteen participants were asked to perform diverse daily indoor activities, e.g., cleaning, sorting, cooking, eating, doing laundry, training/playing with pet, walking, shopping, vacuuming, making bed, exercising, throwing trash, watering plants, sweeping, wiping, while wearing a head-mounted camera. More information can be found in our main paper and supplementary materials.
